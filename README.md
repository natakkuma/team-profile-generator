<h1>Team Profile Generator</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
To build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

<h3>User Story: </h3>
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

<h3>Acceptance Criteria: </h3>
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
<br> WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
<br> THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
<br> WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
<br> THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
<br> WHEN I click on the GitHub username
<br> THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
<br> WHEN I start the application
<br> THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
<br> WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
<br> THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
<br> WHEN I select the engineer option
<br> THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
<br> WHEN I select the intern option
<br> THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
<br> WHEN I decide to finish building my team
<br> THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
